# day 4:  
updated the navigationbottombar for personalfeed/ trendingfeed and profile. Checked the API possibilities of newsapi.org
          and eventregister.org. newsapi.org is worse, because of the possibilities, but free acces.
          evenregister has more possibilities, but is more difficult and max 2000 requests per account
# day 5:  
Used the newsapi.org to make the app. Updated the firebase structure for the user. I included the preferences of the categories and a list  the saved articles.

# day 6:  
Created Tabpages for the fragments. The Profilefragment has three tabs: BioTab, SavedArticlesTab and PreferencesTab. Initialized the newsarticle algorithm for showing the right articles, based on preferences. Updated the walkthrough guide to setup the initial preferences.

# day 7:  
Updated the algorithm and created a articlePage( showing the article) including a likeButton (updates preferences) and saveButton(Store article). 

# day 8:  
Fixed some FirebaseErrors. Created tablayout for the homeFragment including PersonalTab and CountryTab (changing to CategoryTab).
