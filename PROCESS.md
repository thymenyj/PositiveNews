# day 4:  
updated the navigationbottombar for personalfeed/ trendingfeed and profile. Checked the API possibilities of newsapi.org
          and eventregister.org. newsapi.org is worse, because of the possibilities, but free acces.
          evenregister has more possibilities, but is more difficult and max 2000 requests per account
