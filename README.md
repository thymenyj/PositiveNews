An up-to-date knowledge about the society around us can be benificial. There is although a possibility that the users are only focussing on the negativity 
in the society, because there are a lot of negative news articles. This is caused by the effect that negavity has a stronger impact than positivity. 
Why do people reading more negative news articles than positive ones?

People will be starting the day with a positiver worldview when they only read positive news articles. Positivity can improve productivity and decrease stress during.
